# DonorLink
DonorLink is a web application that connects donors with people in need. Built using Next.js, Express, and MongoDB Atlas, it enables donors to fill out a form and share their location, and uses geolocation to match them with nearby volunteers. The application also includes a payment gateway using Razorpay for secure online donations(payment gateway under working).
